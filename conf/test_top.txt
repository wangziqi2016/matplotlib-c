# Using '#' to start a line comment. 
# Line comments can be used at the beginning of a line, or after an existing line
# There is no need to add a semicolon after each line, but we safely ignore them

# Properties are specified using '.'

.xtitle = "This is x title";   # With semicolon
.ytitle = "This is y title"    # Without semicolon
.save-filename = "figure1.pdf" # Can even be in the next line
                              ;
# .legend-filename = "legend.pdf" # This property is optional

# Uncomment this to reveal error
# .unknown-property = "whatever"

# Prints the plot configuration
